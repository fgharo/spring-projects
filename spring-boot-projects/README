This parent project holds various application projects that explore 
spring boot features or libraries compatible with spring boot.

For example, perhaps we are exploring core features such as automatic configuration or
trying out different embedded servers for a service. There are a lot of different applications
one could make with a spring boot project, a rest or soap service, messaging queues,
command line runner, enterprise integrations via fuse or apache camel, etc.  


Alternatively, what if we want to experiment with integrating a spring boot based project
with various libraries for logging (log4j, slf4j/logback, etc), security, metrics, health checks,
lombok, mapstruct, etc.
