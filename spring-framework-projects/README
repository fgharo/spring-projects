This parent project holds various application projects that explore 
spring framework features or libraries compatible with the spring framework.

For example, perhaps we are exploring with core framework features like dependency injection, or 
experimenting with one of the spring modules like jdbc, mvc, security, aop, orm, or test.

Alternatively, what if we want to experiment with integrating a spring framework based project
with various logging libraries (log4j, slf4j/logback, etc) or using other libraries such as lombok or mapstruct.
